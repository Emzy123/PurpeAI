 # PurpleAI Project Plan

     ## Overview

     PurpleAI is a web platform that enables users to generate and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts across Web3 networks using AI-driven code generation. The website features a futuristic, purple-themed user interface, emphasizing accessibility and innovation for Web3 developers.

     ## Features

     - Futuristic UI: A responsive, purple-themed interface with neon accents and smooth animations.
     - AI Code Generation: Users input natural language prompts to generate dApp and smart contract code (e.g., Solidity).
     - Multi-Network Support: Deploy to Web3 networks like Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana.
     - User Authentication: Secure login/signup to save prompt history and generated code.
     - Deployment: Deploy generated contracts to testnets (e.g., Sepolia) via the UI.

     ## Target Users

     - Web3 developers building dApps and smart contracts.
     - Blockchain enthusiasts exploring AI-driven development.
     - Businesses seeking automated Web3 solutions.

     ## Success Criteria
     
     - A fully functional website where users can:
       - Input a prompt and view AI-generated dApp/smart contract code.
       - Deploy generated code to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
       - Interact with a responsive, purple-themed UI.
